# Ground Rules

These define what group members expect from one another and what norms they agree on relating to behaviours and actions. Below are examples of the types of areas it is important to address and examples of what form they might take. 

| Area | Principles & Norms *All members of the group agree to:*  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Communication** |  All communication will be primarily done through Discord, where members are expected to reply to each other's messages/concerns as soon as possible. If they are not available due to circumstances, please communicate this so that the other members know. Communication will consist of deadlines, expectations for team members, idea exploration, and more.  |
| **Meetings** |  Meetings will be conducted on weekly meetings (as needed). Meetings will either be conducted in person in class or virtually through Discord. Members are expected to attend meetings on time and with their expected tasks completed. Members must communicate any challenges that they may have with attending a meeting. Meetings are a time for members to communicate what they have accomplished and ensure everyone is synced up  |
| **Deadlines** |  Members will aim to have work completed AT LEAST the day before the deadline. If this is not obtainable, then members are expected to communicate with one another and provide support in any way they can. Tasks are expected to be completed in full before submission and members are expected to ensure they are aligned with the agreed timeline.  |

| Care Statement Outline here how the team will strive to care for the health of each other and the team as a whole during the project duration: |
| :---- |
|  Members will check in on other group member's tasks to give feedback and offer relief if they are struggling to complete their tasks. Tasks will be delegated evenly, to not overwhelm or leave nothing for any individual group member. Members will let others know if they require assistance or feedback. Members are expected to hold each other accountable.  |

# Deliverables & Deadlines

| **Presentation and early prototype** | Feb 12 | Christos |
| **Full prototype, video, and draft report** | Mar 16 | Georgius |
| **Final prototype, report, presentation** | Mar 31 | An |

| Performance Agreement Considers how the group will address non-performance of what is agreed to. Whatever the group agrees upon should correspond to the impact or gravity of the issues at hand. |
| :---- |
|  Every conflict should be solved as soon as they arise. Members are expected to freely address how they feel, and the other team members will attempt to come up with a resolution that satisfies all. In order to avoid unequal division of tasks, we will keep track of the tasks completed by each person. If we notice that someone is not pulling their weight, we will talk to them as a group and hold them accountable for their parts. As a last resort, if the issue is not resolved we will escalate matters to the professors.  |

# Signatures to the Agreement
