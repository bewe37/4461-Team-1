The chosen phenomena of our group is the creation of Echo Chambers due to the interactions between and with bots on centralized social networking apps.   
One of the key dynamics is between the users and social media platforms, where users expect to use a platform to gain connections with other humans. Instead, users encounter bots who often have other objectives in mind when pushing certain posts/messages. This makes certain groups on a platform appear larger or more dominant than they are and creates a large active social media presence for them. These bots often consist of content creators and amplifiers.  
When the social media platform becomes saturated with discussion on extreme and/or opposing topics, users who disagree with the topics may choose to leave due to a lack of belongingness. If the user is able to identify that they are interacting with bots, they may also choose to leave since the platform is not providing the reason for why they joined in the first place.
